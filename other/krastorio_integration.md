# Short

Some rough sketch how K2 should integrate into EI.

# Duplicates

There are multiple duplicates regarding intermediates, mechanics and entities.
Here are a few and how those could be solved:

**Entities**

- container and tanks: keep both, as they have same sizes let player choose, make both cost same
- transport belts: keep K2 speed progression, make neo belt faster (120s?) and maybe change its color a bit
- loader: Same issue as containers, need to match new speeds
- robots: order K2s bot port after EIs one as "big" version

- solar panels: K2 advanced solar panel as tier 4 variant after EIs best one
- mining drills: tier 1-3 are complete duplicates, keep EI ones?
- furnaces: K2 advanced furnace should be best version, maybe require arc furnace?
- assemblers: K2 advanced assembler should be best version and inline with neo assembler
- crushers: EI already has small crusher, have K2 crusher use EIs crafting category and turn it into and big version of EIs crusher
- filtration plant: in K2 used for dirty water (K2) and quartz -> K2s dirty water will get removed, use it as big brother version of purifier, maybe shift some recipes from purifier to this
- electrolyis plant: utilize for EIs chemistry
- atmospheric condensor: turn into big version of EIs Air filter, remove water from air bc gaia
- advanced chem plant: make into even better version of EIs advanced chem plant
- research server and quantum computer (K2) include in EIs data managment
- advanced lab (K2): maybe switch for standard lab of EI or include as additional step within ages
- singularity lab: dunno yet as EI already has big lab
- singularity beacon: maybe nerf into only 1 module but dont have it count towards beacon limit

**Intermediates**

- K2 glass: use before EIs glass, then turn EIs glass into industrial glass and have it use K2 glass
- K2 silicon: rename into poor quality silicon, use in early game
- rare metals: dunno kinda obsolete through EIs rare metal variants
- immersium: only on gaia, lategame stuff
