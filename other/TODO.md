- 2.0 versions:

- superconductive module -> way less energy, pollution + tiny speed
- AI optimization module -> needs way more power, productivity
- superfluidic mechanics module -> insane speed 

- Alien update:

- other planets for built in mining
- access asteroid and black hole only from Gaia
- move bio chamber to computer age, introduce very odd plating as substitude
- rework computing unit to needs stuff from Gaia (small chain here)
- solar 2,3 needs stuff from gaia
- HTR needs stuff from gaia
- no nuclear/fusion on gaia
- Exotic tech age pack no longer needs rocks from everywhere
- rework high tech parts and their intermediates to be more usefull:

- eu circuit needs best crystals
- magnet needs utopium

- utopium:
- can be found deep down in gaia
-> small perentage in water, neodym(vein)
-> also very small surface spots
-> dedicated veins
-> emtpy veins from aliens

utopium is used for crystal infusion cycles + later on intermediate gen

Grade I utopium: can be mined
works for intermediate boosting
Grade II utopium:
Grade III utopium:

reuse old TTM drill for gas deposits -> gas

Story:
Aliens from Gaia ->get Nauvis, their tech runs on Utopium -> none on nauvis -> ded
