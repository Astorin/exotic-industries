# Techs

- make techs that have multiple steps prerequisites to another
- add tag to vanilla techs to indicate if they count

- listen to mod setting change and migrations

- license and legal note

- make thumbnails like YIR for both mods

vanilla recipes dark age to treat:
(belt)
electric inserter
electric pole
pipe
pipe to ground
repair kit
steam boiler
steam engine
electric miner
water pump
lab
red science
green circ
iron gear wheel
iron stick
copper cable
radar

- copper and steel pipes

animation steam crusher

heat pipe covers

heat pipe upgrade with bots

make oil stuff completely optional

spawn some stones at start or add in ship or starting inv

-- next up

uranium stuff

GFK in computer age

KFK in quantum age

nuclear fission facility for fission tech

Computer age
- normal beacon + modules
- build first supercomputer for later tech research (simulation)
-> techs in between with need of simulation tech / alternative science recipe with simulation / simulation creates 2 or 3 different sci types
-> simulation just needed in quantum stuff
-> supercomputer need different stuff to burn in addition to electricity

- coolant?
- energized crystals <- THIS + electronic parts most needed

- rework modules:

- solar module -> less energy
- computer module -> more production, needs more power
- motor module -> faster speed, more power

- all from 1 - 3

- 2.0 versions:

- superconductive module -> way less energy, pollution + tiny speed
- AI optimization module -> needs way more power, productivity
- superfluidic mechanics module -> insane speed
